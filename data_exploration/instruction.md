# Part 2: Data Cleaning, Analysis, and Interpretation

This is the second part of the Property Value Estimation project, focused on data cleaning, analysis, and interpretation. The goal of this phase is to process the acquired dataset of houses and apartments for sale in Belgium, perform necessary data cleaning operations, conduct exploratory data analysis, and gain insights from the dataset to inform the development of the AI model.

## Getting Started

**Before proceeding with the data cleaning, analysis, and interpretation steps, ensure that you have completed Part 1 of the project, which involved data acquisition. This ensures that you have the required dataset by accessing this [repository](https://github.com/andreia-negreira/immo_scraping_project) as this is the starting point for this phase.**

## Pre-requisites

To run the code and perform the necessary tasks in this phase, make sure you have the following:

* An environment where you can install the requirements.txt (list of dependencies);
* Dataset in csv file containing the acquired dataset;

## Setup and Usage

* Run the main script for data cleaning, analysis, and interpretation by executing python notebook-immo-analysis.ipynb.

## Data Cleaning

During the data cleaning phase, the script will preprocess the acquired dataset to handle any missing values, duplicated rows and inconsistencies. The cleaning process aims to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis and modeling. The specific data cleaning steps may include:

* **Handling missing values:** Imputation or removal of records with missing values.
* **Removing duplicates:** Identifying and removing any duplicate entries in the dataset.

## Data Analysis

Once the dataset is cleaned, the script will perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights and understanding about the dataset's characteristics. This phase involves statistical calculations, visualizations, and data summarization techniques to answer questions and discover patterns. The analysis may include:

* **Visualization:** Creation of visual representations such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to explore relationships and distributions.
* **Correlation analysis:** Assessing the correlation between variables to identify potential predictors of property value.

## Data Interpretation

After conducting the data analysis, whithin the script it is possible to see the summarized key findings and insights obtained from the dataset. Those insights include interpretations of the relationships between variables, important features influencing properties price, and any notable patterns or trends discovered. The insights gained will provide valuable guidance for the subsequent phases of model development and refinement.
